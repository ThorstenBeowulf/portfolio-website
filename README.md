# Portfolio Website

## Goals

The main goals of this project were to build a portfolio webpage to allow me to provide an easy way to view my work. 
The requirements for this page are that it is responsive, easy to read and has functioning links (where possible).

## Implementation

The Features of the page are:

- a consistent font and color scheme
- responsive page layout that re-organises depending on screen size
- navigation links
- mouse-over link pictures that will link to other pages in future
- a semantic page structure to make maintenance and further development easier
